# LiteLLM Observatory - Cursor AI Rules

## Project Overview
Testing orchestrator for LiteLLM deployments. Run test suites against LiteLLM instances and receive results via Slack.

## Essential Documentation
- **Architecture**: See `ARCHITECTURE.md` for project structure and component overview
- **Adding Test Suites**: See `docs/ADDING_TEST_SUITES.md` for complete guide
- **Test Coverage**: See `docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md` for available test suites
- **API Reference**: See `docs/API_REFERENCE.md` for endpoint documentation
- **Environment Variables**: See `docs/ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLES.md` for configuration

## Key Patterns

### Test Suites
- All test suites inherit from `BaseTestSuite` in `litellm_observatory/test_suites/base.py`
- Must implement `async def run(self, **params: Any) -> Dict[str, Any]`
- Register new test suites in `litellm_observatory/models.py` TEST_SUITE_REGISTRY
- Add to `docs/TEST_COVERAGE.md` when creating new test suites

### Code Style
- Keep docstrings concise - avoid obvious comments
- Constants at top of file, self-explanatory names
- Organize class methods: main/public methods first, then helper methods grouped by category with section comments

### API Response Pattern
- HTTP calls from clients to Observatory endpoints should return immediately
- Test results are delivered via integrations (currently Slack webhook), not HTTP responses
- Use `asyncio.create_task()` to run tests in background
- Never block HTTP responses waiting for test completion

### Testing
- Always run `poetry run pytest` before committing
- Test suite must be documented or `test_documentation_coverage.py` will fail
