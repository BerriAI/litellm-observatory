# Problem Tracker

## Architecture Overview
We're building a **Testing Orchestrator** that can:
- Point to multiple LiteLLM deployments
- Make requests to those deployments
- Run various test suites against each deployment
- Collect and report test results

## Goal
The ultimate goal of this project is to have multiple test suites for different purposes:

- **Performance Tests**: Measure latency, throughput, and resource utilization
- **Reliability Tests**: Validate consistency, error handling, and fault tolerance
- **Provider Tests**: Verify compatibility and correctness across different LLM providers
- **API Validation Tests**: Ensure proper request/response handling and schema compliance
- **Integration Tests**: Test end-to-end workflows and real-world usage scenarios
